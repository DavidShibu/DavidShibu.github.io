This task was comparitevely easier when compared to other tasks. I installed hugo in my terminal created a new hugo file using hugo new site {file_name}. After that I cloned a template named "coder" as a submodule in themes folder. Submodule is used inorder to get furthur updates. After that I started configuring the configure.toml file according to my needs. The theme is imported and the synatx for special features are added.



Avatar image, hyperlinks, descriptions etc are added.In blog page a readme file is created explaining the process. In the projects page, youtube links with their preview is added with the help of template.




The finished webpage is hosted using github pages.
In github a public repository is created inorder to host the webpage and saved in the format username.github.io.
The finished webpage is pushed into the repository.


Problems faced:
Major problem faced was to remove the brazil flag in the webpage. I checked all the source code but couldnt find it and it is stil present in the webpage.
