I am David Shibu currently a students at IIT Madras doing offcampus B.S in Data science and applications degree along with B.tech in Computer Science and Engineering from Amrita Vishwavidhyapeetham.
I believe that I am a smart working student and can efficiently manage time and contribute to the groups and societies I am in. I am open to the world of knowledge, acquiring it throughout my lifetime,
improving myself from day to day and to better in all aspects. <br>


I am more inclined towards trading, quant analysts, Mathematics and computing. I love solving programming related questions and always seek more knowledge about algorithms. 
I believe that I can perform well in all aspects under stress or hard times efficiently and clear my part. I like to see my society grow along with me, for that I am ready to help my fellow mates if they are facing any issues on something by sharing what I know.
